# Double-Top-Pattern-Detector

This is a C++ project that I wrote for one of my college courses. The program reads csv files containing stock data and detects if a double-top pattern is present. The results of the detections are written inside new csv files.

NOTE: When downloading the executable, download the data_files folder. Then, launch the executable with the data_files folder in the same directory.
